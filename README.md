App built for BondRX autostaining robot multiplex reagent prep list, simply create your list to prep your reagent easily by setting up the slides and reagents needed from here.

Global settings- Normally you do not need to change this unless it's a BondIII (older version), where the dead volume is 600uL. Other models might require different volume but currently this app only supports BondRX.
